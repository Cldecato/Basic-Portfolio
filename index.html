                <p>
                    I was born in Enfield, NH. I lived there until the age of 5 and then for the rest of my childhood I resided in York, ME. Being the middle child in a sandwich of two brothers, I am very competetive. Growing up I went to all York public schools and played a long list of sports. Some of my favorite sports are hockey, golf, football, basketball, baseball, tennis and ultimate frisbee (which I picked up playing in college). After high school I attended the University of Richmond and graduated with a Bachelors degree in Cognitive Science. I am now living in Portsmouth, NH and working as a Manager at When Pig's Fly Pizzeria and a Server at Ristarante Massimo. I still have a profound love of sports and games. I love being outdoors and enjoying nature.

<!--I would like to figure out how to get a cool background gradient like the gray one from the example in here but decided to spend my limited time focusing on other areas. Will come back to it later.//-->
